# [NULL]'s DRG Mods
A public storage repository for all my mods, including WIPs and stuff not uploaded to mod.io.

# Uncooked Blueprints
  Blueprints from finished and WIP mods. Requires placement into a Community Modkit uproject with MudHub and DRGLib to function properly.
  
  BoltTypeIndicator: WIP mod that adds the bolt type to a customizable widget on the HUD
  
  C4Maggots: WIP mod that makes magma maggots blow-up like c4 (or worse) on kill.
  
  CPT: Closer Promotion Terminal. A direct port of ArcticEcho's mod of the same name, taken from his source code.
  
  DotF: Dwarves of the Future. Abandoned WIP cosmetic project.
  
  HiveguardSwarms: Unstarted project that aims to make Hiveguard fights more dynamic by making waves spawn, potentially with new enemies(?).
  
  VPC: Voice Pitch Changer. Currently abandoned WIP mod that lets you change the pitches of dwarves' voices. Might return to it later.
