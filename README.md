# [NULL]'s DRG Mods
A public storage repository for all my Deep Rock Galactic mods, including source code, WIPs, and stuff not uploaded to [my Mod.io profile](https://mod.io/u/null26/).

# Pak Files and Content Folders
  Pak files of my mods from Mod.io plus some unreleased and test content. Names match names on Mod.io. Cooked Content has been packaged by Unreal Engine 4.27.2. Uncooked Content has not been packaged and thus can be viewed in Unreal Engine 4.27.2. Uncooked audio content require the [Audio Modding Template](https://github.com/DRG-Modding/Audio-Modding-Template)'s files to fully work.

# Uncooked Blueprints
  Blueprints from finished and WIP mods, viewable and editable in Unreal Engine 4.27.2. Requires placement into a [Community Modkit](https://github.com/DRG-Modding/Community-Modkit) uproject with [DRGLib](https://github.com/SamsDRGMods/DRGLib)'s developer files to function properly.
  
### BoltTypeIndicator:
  WIP mod that adds the Boltshark crossbow bolt type to a customizable widget on the HUD.
  
### C4Maggots:
  WIP mod that makes magma maggots blow-up like c4 (or worse) on kill.
  
### CPT:
  [Closer Promotion Terminal (Updated)](https://mod.io/g/drg/m/closer-promotion-terminal-updated). A direct port of ArcticEcho's mod of the same name, taken from his source code.
  
### DotF:
  Dwarves of the Future. Abandoned WIP cosmetic project.
  
### HiveguardSwarms:
  Unstarted project that aims to make Hiveguard fights more dynamic by making waves spawn, potentially with new enemies(?).
  
### VPC:
  Voice Pitch Changer. Currently abandoned WIP mod that lets you change the pitches of dwarves' voices. Might return to it later.
