# nulls-drg-mods
A public storage repository for all my mods, including WIPs and stuff not uploaded to mod.io.

UNCOOKED BLUEPRINTS
  Blueprints from finished and WIP mods. Requires placement into a Community Modkit uproject with MudHub and DRGLib to function properly.
   BoltTypeIndicator: WIP mod that adds the bolt type to a cusotmizable widget on the HUD
   C4Maggots: WIP mod that makes magma maggots blow-up like c4 (or worse) on kill.
   CPT: Closer Promotion Terminal. A direct port of ArcticEcho's mod of the same name, taken from his source code.
   DotF: Dwarves of the Future. Abandoned WIP cosmetic project.
   HiveguardSwarms: Unstarted project that aims to make Hiveguard fights more dynamic by making waves spawn, potentially with new enemies(?).
   VPC: Voice Pitch Changer. Currently abandoned WIP mod that lets you change the pitches of dwarves' voices. Might return to it later.
